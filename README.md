# ISLator â€“ Indian Sign Language Translator (Rule-Based)

ISLator is a rule-based system developed to convert Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures into textual output. This project aims to bridge communication gaps for the Indian hearing-impaired community by providing an accessible and accurate ISL-to-text translation system.

Features

Rule-Based Translation: Utilizes predefined gesture-to-text rules for reliable conversion.
Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Processes video or live camera feed for immediate translation.
Lightweight and Efficient: Does not require heavy deep learning models, making it suitable for low-resource environments.
Text Output: Converts recognized ISL gestures into readable text for communication.
